On March 29, Chicago will enter Covid vaccine [phase 1C](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid19-vaccine/home/vaccine-distribution-phases.html). This phase will include most Chicago residents, such as those working in retail, media, IT, communications, and real estate. There‚Äôs a good write-up on the current state of the vaccination effort [here](https://thetriibe.com/2021/03/most-chicagoans-will-be-eligible-for-vaccine-beginning-march-29-but-not-everyone-will-be-able-to-get-vaccinated-immediately/). All that said, many could likely get vaccinated before the mentioned date via one of the following methods:

- Call your primary care physician or main clinic, they may have extra vaccines or may have had appointment cancellations.
- Join the [Chicago Vaccine Hunters Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1864372350383607/) ‚Äî members post ways of getting appointments there regularly (including when particular websites get more appointments).
- The below websites allow you to book appointments online. Some have appointments posted sporadically throughout the day, others allow you to choose from a calendar of available appointment dates:
	- [Cook County health](https://cookcountypublichealth.org/communicable-diseases/covid-19/covid-vaccine/)
	- [Rush Hospital](https://www.rush.edu/patients-visitors/covid-19-resources/covid-19-vaccines/schedule-covid-19-vaccination)
	- [UIC](https://hospital.uillinois.edu/primary-and-specialty-care/infectious-diseases/covid-19-coronavirus/vaccine)
	- [United Center](https://events.juvare.com/chicago/UCPOD/) - a code is needed to book via this website, but it‚Äôs possible to call the following number to get an appointment instead (if qualified): 3128640590
	- [Walgreens](https://www.walgreens.com/findcare/vaccination/covid-19)
	- [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/cp/1228302)
	- [Zocdoc](https://www.zocdoc.com/vaccine)
